# Spooky

This repository contains the source code for the Spooky project. All TypeScript files are formatted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). A Prettier configuration is included so formatting can be run consistently across the code base.

## Formatting

Run the following command to automatically format TypeScript and TSX files:

```bash
npm run format
```

The configuration ensures double quotes, trailing commas where valid, and semicolons.
